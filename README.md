notebooks and data for the publication:
Coal exit health and environmental damage reductions outweigh economic impacts

- A list of the activities and the corresponding REMIND technologies
can be found at
\url{https://github.com/rauner/holistic-coal-exit/blob/master/notebooks/helpers/activitymaps.py}.
- Notebooks and input data for LCA
calculations[https://github.com/rauner/holistic-coal-exit].
- To assess the impacts from non-electricity energy carriers, relevant
processes are chosen from the ecoinvent database and the specific
impact attributed to the secondary energy carrier from the REMIND
model [see https://github.com/rauner/holistic-coal-exit/blob/master/data/ecoinventtoREMINDtechmap.csv].
- Impact assessment results are calculated using the "Hierarchist"
version of ReCiPe. In this variant, medium time frames are used for
impacts, e.g., 100 years for the GWP.
